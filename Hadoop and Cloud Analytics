Cloud Analytics (Hadoop + Cloud) Course 5th Session

1.Cloud Analytics -future of Hadoop and How cloud is affecting the hadoop 
space

2. Hadoop 1 Architecture

3. Hadoop components

Components  -MasterNodes  -WorkerNode
HDFS        -NameNode,    SNN-DN
Processing   Job Tracker  Task Tracker

4.Hadoop 1 Limitation
   1.SPOF of Name Node
   2.High Intensive Job Tracker

Hadoop 2
   SPOF overcome by High Availability/HDFS Federation
   High Intensive Job Tracker overcome by YARN-Yet Naother Resource Negotiator


Job Tracker-->Resource Manager--->Application Manager
                                  Schedular

Task Tracker---> Node Manager---->Container
                                  Application Master

Hadoop1 suppose if you are processing -then it is called as Mapreduce1
Hadoop2(YARN) if you are processing-then it is called as Mapreduce2
Hadoop2-HA+Yarn
Hadoop1-SPOF Name Node
Hadoop2-HA+Checkpoint server(SNN)+Journal Node Control by Zookeeper

Hadoop1- You can run at a time only job
Hadoop2-You can run at a time multiple jobs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The FIFO Scheduler -First in First Out-->Default in Hadoop1-Job1--->Job2
CapacityScheduler, -Configures capacity in XML file-Job1-1 hr Job2-30 minutes-75%-job1 25% job2, both are running at the same time,
and FairScheduler-
-------------------------------------
OpenSource vs Distribution
Hadoop opensource-Enterprise  they are not using as it is.
Hadoop Distribution-Cloudera+Hortonworks ,MapR

local filesystem Commands:
ls
ls -lrt
mkdir test
ls -ltr test
cd test
cat>>a.txt
ss
s
s
s
pwd
cat a.txt
cp
mv
rm

HDFS command:
hadoop fs -put inputfile.txt test.txt
hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera
hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/test.txt
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/todayclass
hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal sample.txt  /user/cloudera/todayclass/simple.txt
hadoop fs -get /user/cloudera/todayclass/simple.txt bada.txt
hadoop fs -Ddfs.replication=4 -cp /user/cloudera/todayclass/simple.txt  /user/cloudera/sample.txt

sudo -u hdfs hdfs fsck /user/cloudera/todayclass/ -files -blocks -locations
